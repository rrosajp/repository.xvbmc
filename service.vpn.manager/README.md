VPN Manager for OpenVPN
=======================

This add-on is a combination of program add-on and service.  It allows the configuration and switching between different VPN profiles/locations.  It will reconnect to a VPN on boot and then maintain the VPN connection based on the add-ons being used.  It's primary function is to avoid having to mess with VPNs once everything is set up.

It was most definitely inspired by wanting to improve on the excellent VPN for OPENELEC from the MetalKettle repo (which I borrowed the regex expression from for working out where the VPN was pretending to be located...).  It relies on the openvpn to do the dirty network stuff.

To use this add-on, first set up a connection to a VPN provider and then validate with at least one profile.  The first of these is the primary VPN which will be used to reconnect at boot.

Using the Add-on Filter, identify which add-ons will use which VPN and which add-ons will not use a VPN at all.  As the add-on is selected, the VPN will automatically switch to the correct profile.  When an add-on is used that doesn't have a filter, the previous VPN profile to any filtering will be reverted to.  When configuring the filters, you must restart the service (on the Settings/Monitor tab) to start using the changes.

Multiple VPNs can be selected for a single add-on.  What this means is that when you switch to an add-on, if you have a current VPN which is one of the multiple VPNs identifed then that VPN will continue to be used.  If your current VPN is not one of the multiple VPNs identified, then it'll select the lowest number VPN.

Other VPN profiles can be used via the VPN Manager for OpenELEC add-on in the Program section.

Additionally, primary VPN profiles can be cycled through either using the add-on menu, or at any time, a button on the remote.  On pressing the button the first time, the current VPN state will be displayed.  Subsequent presses will cycle around the available connections (and optionally disconnect).
After a short period (~10 seconds), the VPN last displayed will be connected.  If you don't want this to happen, cycle back to the current connected VPN.  If the network is active during a switch any traffic will likely be disrupted

To set up the cycle funtion, there's a remote.xml file within the add-on zip which shows how to map the cycle function onto a key (I'm using the blue key on my remote).  You can use the Keymap Editor add-on to create an xml file within the userdata directory (/storage/.kodi/userdata/keymaps) and edit it to contain the RunScript command show in remote.xml.

Finally, there's a bunch of other options to turn some of the behaviour described on and off.  Everything is defaulted to sensible behaviour.

And because I was having some wireless issues when developing this, I also added a speed test into the option menu, just for fun...has nothing to do with VPNs though!
